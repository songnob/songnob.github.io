# CodePath Android Cliffnotes

Welcome to the open-source [CodePath](http://codepath.com) Android Cliffnotes! Our goal is to become the **central crowdsourced resource** for complete and up-to-date practical Android developer guides for any topic. [[Just take me to the notes|Home#getting-started]]!

[![CodePath](https://i.imgur.com/XgxWfyF.png)](http://codepath.com)

We have Android guides for everyone whether you are a **beginner, intermediate or expert**. Want to learn how to [[use the ActionBar|Defining the ActionBar]] or the [[ins and outs of fragments|Creating and Using Fragments]]? We got that. Want to learn [[about automated unit testing|Unit Testing with Robolectric]] or how to [[build flexible user interfaces for multiple devices|Flexible User Interfaces]]? We got you covered. We don't waste time with the "theoretical approach" you might get from a book. We cover **exactly the things we use every day** as we are developing apps for contracts.

**Need Help?** Please join this [gitter real-time chat](https://gitter.im/thecodepath/public) or the [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codepath-android-guides) for these guides where you can post related questions. You can also [get 1:1 mentorship online](https://www.codementor.io/android-experts) through codementor.

## Motivation

Ever been **frustrated finding information on outdated one-off blog posts and tutorials** that have long since become irrelevant? How many times have you been googling to find your answer only exists on an obscure **2 year old StackOverflow post**? We believe there's got to be a better way. Why not have the community work together to create useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of Android (or any platform)? There's absolutely no reason that we should have to make do with vague and outdated content anymore.

Read about our [[mission to change the way engineers learn new technologies|CodePath-Goal]] and check out how you can [[get involved|CodePath-Goal#how-do-i-help]]! In addition, we are at present a fledgling startup so if you like this guide and what we are trying to do, please consider following us on twitter [@codepath](https://twitter.com/codepath)! 

## Overview

The cliffnotes below are **categorized by their topic**, so you can easily find guides on related topics whether that is views, styling, testing, or using sensors. If you see an error, incorrect explanation or deprecated solution, **why not contribute back** and make these cliffnotes better for the next person? That in a nutshell is the core spirit of this initiative. Check out the [list of contributors](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/blob/master/README.md#contributors) to this project.

**Disclaimer:** We have scoured the web endlessly for content while creating these guides and adapted content from many source including the [Google Official Docs](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/index.html), [Vogella Tutorials](http://www.vogella.com/android.html) and countless other sources that had hidden gems of information. At the bottom of each guide, there are citations for the content we used. **We don't claim the content is original** (although we did develop quite a bit ourselves), but unlike those other sources listed, it is freely community editable. We have openly adapted, modified and brought together this content from all the sources we could find for the benefit of every engineer.
